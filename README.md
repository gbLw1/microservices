# Microservices

## Introduction

This repository is [.NET Microservices â€“ Full Course](https://youtu.be/DgVjEo3OGBI) from Les Jackson on Youtube

## Testing

To keep it simple, we are going to test the application endpoints using http rather than https for the most part for various reasons, more especially when you come to kubernetes, it becomes very complex and it's going to detract from the main focus of the course.

## Docker guide

You can find a Docker guide in the [Docker.md](./docs/Docker.md) file that might be useful to help you get started and follow along with the course.

## Kubernetes guide

You can find a Kubernetes guide in the [Kubernetes.md](./docs/Kubernetes.md) file that might be useful to understand how it works and some basic commands to help you get started.

## Messaging

You can check the [Messaging.md](./docs/Messaging.md) file to understand how **asynchronous** and **synchronous** messaging works in the microservices architecture.
